## Install by Copying

`ivue` is designed to be easily shareable and installable so if you are running TypeScript, you can just copy the
`ivue.ts` into your repo and you are done:

::: tip NOTE
This installation path is recommended only if you quickly want to tinker with the internals of ivue, as you won't be getting the latest updates. Also note that this code comes from github `main` branch latest which might also be in beta and not fully published to `npm`.
